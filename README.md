# Python -> Robocorp Bootcamp

This is my personal 12-week learning journey from Python basics to Robocorp automation.

------

Week 1
Included a lot of flailing around and just getting back to basics with syntaxes etc.
Set up environments (visual studio code, github).
Completed some practices and "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" chapters 1-3, included while/for looping, \
if/else conditions, local/global variables and other basic stuff.

------

Week 2
Started practicing source control to use branching in the same way proper organizations do \
as in creating feature branches which I would then push to GitHub and request a pull request \
compare code and merge. Continued with "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" going over chapters 4-6.

Chapter 4 included lists (joining, slicing), nested logic, loops, axes and arrays.

Chapter 5 was about dictionaries and structuring data. Chapter practice projects included \
creating a chess board validator (checks if given input dictionary chess board is valid) and a \
fantasy game dictionary (added items from a list to inventory dictionary).

Chapter 6 is manipulating strings. Learned about different ways of manipulating strings \
including but not limited to justifying, stripping, joining, slicing etc.
Also had practice projects for writing Python scripts that are run via CLI.

------

Week 3
Working through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" chapter 7 and 8.

Chapter 7 - RegEx
Practicing different forms of RegEx syntaxes.
Bunch of practice projects related to different kind of regular expressions.

Chapter 8 - Validating Input Data
Learning how to validate input data with PyInputPlus.
Couple practice projects related to input data validation and PyInputPlus.

------

Week 4
Working through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" chapter 9 and 10.

Chapter 9 - Reading and Writing Files
Learning about different ways of file manipulation and path syntaxes etc.
Couple projects related to shelve-module and file manipulation as well as RegEx pattern file searches.

Chapter 10 - Organizing Files
Learning about file organization e.g. moving/deleting/renaming files and folders.
Few practice projects which were about looping files in a given folder path and \
deleting/renaming/copying them.

------

Week 5
Working through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" chapter 11 and 12.

Chapter 11 - Debugging
Learned about debugging in general:
- how to use debugger
- how to do assertion sanity checks
- logging levels
- raising exceptions
- assertions for programming bugs, exceptions for user errors

Practice project related to debugging.

Chapter 12 - Web Scraping
