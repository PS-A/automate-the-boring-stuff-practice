# Python -> Robocorp Bootcamp

This is my personal 12-week learning journey from Python basics to Robocorp automation.

Week 1
Included a lot of flailing around and just getting back to basics with syntaxes etc.
Completed some practices and "Automate the Boring Stuff" chapters 1-3, included while/for looping, \
if/else conditions, local/global variables and other basic stuff.

Week 2
Started practicing source control to use branching in the same way proper organizations do \
as in creating feature branches which I would then push to GitHub and request a pull request \
compare code and merge.
Continued with "Automate the Boring Stuff" going over chapters 4-6, included lists (joining, slicing), \
nested logic, loops, axes and arrays.
